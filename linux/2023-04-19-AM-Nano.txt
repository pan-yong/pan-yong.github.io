Nano is a good text editer, simple and useful, i like it.
So i decided to write linux notes in nano every day. Aha, interesting.

1) nano arguments
eg. nano -mi notes.txt
-m active mouse
-i automatic indent, is convenient when writing code.

2) nano configuration file
~/.nanorc
set autoindent
set mouse       

/etc/nanorc

3) quick key
Ctrl+ G  help
Alt + M  active mouse
Ctrl+ 6  Mark set, then use mouse 

Other usful text editer: vi/vim, gedit...
