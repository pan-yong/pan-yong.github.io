## A Visit to a Car Factory

###### Going to the Factory

One morning my dad came to wake me up early. "Surprise!" he said. "You get to come to work with me." My dad has the best job ever. He works in an automobile factory. They make cars there. 

###### Engineers

My dad is an engineer. That means he helps plan how a car will look and work. Dad works with other engineers. They work together so the car will be safe and run great. Dad and his team draw their plans. They look like this. I want to be an engineer, So, I draw my own plans.

###### Getting the Parts

When the plans are ready, the car can be built. But first, factory workers must make or buy all the parts for the car. There are hundreds of parts! A car needs springs, brakes, and a steering wheel. It needs pistons, valves, and more. It is not easy to build a car!

###### Assembly

Once they have the parts, workers can put the car together. This is called assembly. They work in teams. Each team builds a different part of the car. One team builds the engine. Another builds the body. Another is in charge of the wheels and tires. There are many teams with many different jobs. All of them are important. Each team checks its work carefully. They want the people drive the car to be safe. Engineers check the work, too.

###### Ready for Sale

 When the cars are ready, the go to a shipping yard. The shipping yard sends them to dealers. Sometimes the cars go by boat. Sometimes they go by truck. Then people buy the cars from the dealers. When I see cars on the road, I feel proud of my dad. He makes good cars for people to enjoy.

When I grow up, I'm going to work at the car factory, too!
